# Task 3: Viscoelasticity

We recommend using the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for this task. Once uv is installed, simply execute the following line via the terminal:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This will create a _virtual environment_, install all required packages, and run the `main.py` script. For more details on python project management with uv checkout the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
